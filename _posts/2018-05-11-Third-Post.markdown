## How do you do bullet points, bold, italics, etc. in markdown?
Pls just list syntax; no spam pls :)
* You do the corresponding numbers of "#" to do each Header
  * i.e.,
    # Header 1 is this
    ## Header 2 is this
    ### Header 3 is this
    #### Header 4 is this
    ##### Header 5 is this
    ###### Header 6 is this
* You can do an ordered list two ways:
  * One way is to do "* ", which does bullet points
  * The other way is to have each number, a period, and a space like "#. " to have a numbered list
    * Tab and then have a point to have an indented sub-bullet
* Make links by having closed brackets with links in them.
  * For example,
  <code>
